# Wally's Wonderful Festival App

## Description
The festival app is an admin utility for viewing details of the various shows, itineraries, and users for their festival.

## Features
- A homepage to view all of the itineraries available, as well as using a radio button to filter by All, Day 1 or Day 2. The admin can click on an itinerary card to view more details
- A details page to view additional details, which is the users signed up to it and the shows as part of it. The admin can choose to delete a show from this view.

The app is built using **React** and leverages **React Router** for navigation, and communicates to a back end rails application that lives here: [Back End](https://github.com/wally-yawn/rails-api-starter-final)

## Approaches to Building
- **Component-Driven Development**: The app is structured with reusable components such as `UserCards`, `ShowCards`, `ItineraryCards`, `UserContainer`, `ShowContainer`, `ItineraryContainer`, `Details` and `App` to improve maintainability and scalability.
- **React Router**: Implemented for seamless navigation between pages, ensuring a dynamic and user-friendly experience.
- **Testing**: End-to-end testing with **Cypress** ensures that the app functions correctly and meets user story requirements.
